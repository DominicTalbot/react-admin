Welcome to my React Dashboard project! This is a modern admin dashboard built with React and Material-UI,
featuring customizable themes, a collapsible sidebar, and reusable components. It's designed to be practical,
polished, and a showcase of what I can build with React.

```

## Key Files
- **`App.jsx`**: Manages routing and theme context. Additional routes are ready to go—just uncomment or add them.
- **`Sidebar.jsx`**: Handles the collapsible menu, with user profile info included when expanded.
- **`Topbar.jsx`**: Contains theme toggling and useful action icons like notifications and settings.
- **`theme.js`**: All the theme logic and color tokens in one place for easy updates.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the core of the application.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Provides sleek, modern components.
- **React Router**: Manages routing between different pages.
- **React Pro Sidebar**: Makes building and styling the sidebar much simpler.

## Usage
### Adding a New Page
1. Add a route in `App.jsx`:
   ```jsx
   <Route path="/new-page" element={<NewPage />} />
   ```
2. Create a new file (e.g., `NewPage.jsx`) for your component.
3. Add a corresponding menu item in `Sidebar.jsx`.

### Customizing the Sidebar
1. Add a menu item:
   ```jsx
   <MenuItem icon={<NewIcon />}>New Section</MenuItem>
   ```
2. Link it to a new route using `react-router-dom`.

## Components Overview
### **Topbar**
The Topbar includes:
- A search bar with Material-UI's `InputBase`.
- Theme toggling with icons for dark/light mode.
- Interactive action icons for notifications, settings, and profile management.

### **Sidebar**
The sidebar:
- Collapses/expands for better screen utilization.
- Includes customizable menu items and a user profile section.
- Uses `react-pro-sidebar` for a flexible and functional design.

### **Header**
A modular component for displaying titles and subtitles. It helps maintain consistency across different pages.

### **Theme**
Implemented with Material-UI’s `createTheme` and a custom context.
